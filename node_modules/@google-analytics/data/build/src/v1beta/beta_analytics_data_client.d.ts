     * Returns a customized report of your Google Analytics event data. Reports

     * tracking code. The data returned from the API is as a table with columns
     * for the requested dimensions and metrics. Metrics are individual
     * measurements of user activity on your property, such as active users or
     * event count. Dimensions break down metrics across some common criteria,
     * such as country or event name.
     *
     * For a guide to constructing requests & understanding responses, see
     * [Creating a
     * Report](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics).
     *
     * @param {Object} request
     *   The request object that will be sent.
     * @param {string} request.property
     *   A Google Analytics property identifier whose events are tracked.
     *   Specified in the URL path and not the body. To learn more, see [where to
     *   find your Property
     *   ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/property-id).
     *   Within a batch request, this property should either be unspecified or
     *   consistent with the batch-level property.
     *
     *   Example: properties/1234
     * @param {number[]} request.dimensions
     *   The dimensions requested and displayed.
     * @param {number[]} request.metrics
     *   The metrics requested and displayed.
     * @param {number[]} request.dateRanges
     *   Date ranges of data to read. If multiple date ranges are requested, each
     *   response row will contain a zero based date range index. If two date
     *   ranges overlap, the event data for the overlapping days is included in the
     *   response rows for both date ranges. In a cohort request, this `dateRanges`
     *   must be unspecified.
     * @param {google.analytics.data.v1beta.FilterExpression} request.dimensionFilter
     *   Dimension filters let you ask for only specific dimension values in
     *   the report. To learn more, see [Fundamentals of Dimension
     *   Filters](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics#dimension_filters)
     *   for examples. Metrics cannot be used in this filter.
     * @param {google.analytics.data.v1beta.FilterExpression} request.metricFilter
     *   The filter clause of metrics. Applied after aggregating the report's rows,
     *   similar to SQL having-clause. Dimensions cannot be used in this filter.
     * @param {number} request.offset
     *   The row count of the start row. The first row is counted as row 0.
     *
     *   When paging, the first request does not specify offset; or equivalently,
     *   sets offset to 0; the first request returns the first `limit` of rows. The
     *   second request sets offset to the `limit` of the first request; the second
     *   request returns the second `limit` of rows.
     *
     *   To learn more about this pagination parameter, see
     *   [Pagination](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics#pagination).
     * @param {number} request.limit
     *   The number of rows to return. If unspecified, 10,000 rows are returned. The
     *   API returns a maximum of 250,000 rows per request, no matter how many you
     *   ask for. `limit` must be positive.
     *
     *   The API can also return fewer rows than the requested `limit`, if there
     *   aren't as many dimension values as the `limit`. For instance, there are
     *   fewer than 300 possible values for the dimension `country`, so when
     *   reporting on only `country`, you can't get more than 300 rows, even if you
     *   set `limit` to a higher value.
     *
     *   To learn more about this pagination parameter, see
     *   [Pagination](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics#pagination).
     * @param {number[]} request.metricAggregations
     *   Aggregation of metrics. Aggregated metric values will be shown in rows
     *   where the dimension_values are set to "RESERVED_(MetricAggregation)".
     *   Aggregates including both comparisons and multiple date ranges will
     *   be aggregated based on the date ranges.
     * @param {number[]} request.orderBys
     *   Specifies how rows are ordered in the response.
     *   Requests including both comparisons and multiple date ranges will
     *   have order bys applied on the comparisons.
     * @param {string} request.currencyCode
     *   A currency code in ISO4217 format, such as "AED", "USD", "JPY".
     *   If the field is empty, the report uses the property's default currency.
     * @param {google.analytics.data.v1beta.CohortSpec} request.cohortSpec
     *   Cohort group associated with this request. If there is a cohort group
     *   in the request the 'cohort' dimension must be present.
     * @param {boolean} request.keepEmptyRows
     *   If false or unspecified, each row with all metrics equal to 0 will not be
     *   returned. If true, these rows will be returned if they are not separately
     *   removed by a filter.
     *
     *   Regardless of this `keep_empty_rows` setting, only data recorded by the
     *   Google Analytics property can be displayed in a report.
     *
     *   For example if a property never logs a `purchase` event, then a query for
     *   the `eventName` dimension and  `eventCount` metric will not have a row
     *   eventName: "purchase" and eventCount: 0.
     * @param {boolean} request.returnPropertyQuota
     *   Toggles whether to return the current state of this Google Analytics
     *   property's quota. Quota is returned in [PropertyQuota](#PropertyQuota).
     * @param {number[]} [request.comparisons]
     *   Optional. The configuration of comparisons requested and displayed. The
     *   request only requires a comparisons field in order to receive a comparison
     *   column in the response.
     * @param {object} [options]
     *   Call options. See {@link https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/google-gax/latest/interfaces/CallOptions.html|CallOptions} for more details.
     * @returns {Promise} - The promise which resolves to an array.
