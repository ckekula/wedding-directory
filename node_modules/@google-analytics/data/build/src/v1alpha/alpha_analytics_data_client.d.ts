     * Feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwOlQDJAUoBiIgUZZ3S_Lwi8gr7Bb0k1jhvc-DEg7Rol3UjA/viewform).
     *
     * @param {Object} request
     *   The request object that will be sent.
     * @param {string} [request.property]
     *   Optional. A Google Analytics property identifier whose events are tracked.
     *   Specified in the URL path and not the body. To learn more, see [where to
     *   find your Property
     *   ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/property-id).
     *   Within a batch request, this property should either be unspecified or
     *   consistent with the batch-level property.
     *
     *   Example: properties/1234
     * @param {number[]} [request.dateRanges]
     *   Optional. Date ranges of data to read. If multiple date ranges are
     *   requested, each response row will contain a zero based date range index. If
     *   two date ranges overlap, the event data for the overlapping days is
     *   included in the response rows for both date ranges.
     * @param {google.analytics.data.v1alpha.Funnel} [request.funnel]
     *   Optional. The configuration of this request's funnel. This funnel
     *   configuration is required.
     * @param {google.analytics.data.v1alpha.FunnelBreakdown} [request.funnelBreakdown]
     *   Optional. If specified, this breakdown adds a dimension to the funnel table
     *   sub report response. This breakdown dimension expands each funnel step to
     *   the unique values of the breakdown dimension. For example, a breakdown by
     *   the `deviceCategory` dimension will create rows for `mobile`, `tablet`,
     *   `desktop`, and the total.
     * @param {google.analytics.data.v1alpha.FunnelNextAction} [request.funnelNextAction]
     *   Optional. If specified, next action adds a dimension to the funnel
     *   visualization sub report response. This next action dimension expands each
     *   funnel step to the unique values of the next action. For example a next
     *   action of the `eventName` dimension will create rows for several events
     *   (for example `session_start` & `click`) and the total.
     *
     *   Next action only supports `eventName` and most Page / Screen dimensions
     *   like `pageTitle` and `pagePath`.
     * @param {google.analytics.data.v1alpha.RunFunnelReportRequest.FunnelVisualizationType} [request.funnelVisualizationType]
     *   Optional. The funnel visualization type controls the dimensions present in
     *   the funnel visualization sub report response. If not specified,
     *   `STANDARD_FUNNEL` is used.
     * @param {number[]} [request.segments]
     *   Optional. The configurations of segments. Segments are subsets of a
     *   property's data. In a funnel report with segments, the funnel is evaluated
     *   in each segment.
     *
     *   Each segment specified in this request
     *   produces a separate row in the response; in the response, each segment
     *   identified by its name.
     *
     *   The segments parameter is optional. Requests are limited to 4 segments.
     * @param {number} [request.limit]
     *   Optional. The number of rows to return. If unspecified, 10,000 rows are
     *   returned. The API returns a maximum of 250,000 rows per request, no matter
     *   how many you ask for. `limit` must be positive.
     *
     *   The API can also return fewer rows than the requested `limit`, if there
     *   aren't as many dimension values as the `limit`.
     * @param {google.analytics.data.v1alpha.FilterExpression} [request.dimensionFilter]
     *   Optional. Dimension filters allow you to ask for only specific dimension
     *   values in the report. To learn more, see [Creating a Report: Dimension
     *   Filters](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics#dimension_filters)
     *   for examples. Metrics cannot be used in this filter.
     * @param {boolean} [request.returnPropertyQuota]
     *   Optional. Toggles whether to return the current state of this Analytics
     *   Property's quota. Quota is returned in [PropertyQuota](#PropertyQuota).
     * @param {object} [options]
     *   Call options. See {@link https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/google-gax/latest/interfaces/CallOptions.html|CallOptions} for more details.
